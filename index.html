September as a MMJ Reporter,. \n\nAlyssa comes to you from the total opposite end of the state, a small rural community, Lenoir, in Western North Carolina.\n\nAlyssa received her bachelor's degree in Broadcast Journalism from High Point University where she was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha. \n\nAfter ending a ten-year softball experience Alyssa turned in her cleats for heels and began competing in pageantry where she has held several state titles with the most recent being Miss North Carolina Collegiate and Miss Southern States.\n\nAs you can see, Alyssa has spent a lot of time in front of an audience, whether it was on a softball field, or a stage and she can't wait to get to work delivering the news to you.\n\nOutside of the news station in addition to pageantry, Alyssa enjoys traveling. Living like a local in whatever new city she's in is her favorite thing to do. Whether that's relaxing by sipping coffee or zip lining over the ocean. Whatever is offered Alyssa is up for the challenge! \n\nAlyssa looks forward to her future here in Eastern North Carolina and the time that she will get to spend with you in the community.","slug":"","instagram":"alyssahefner.news

Growing up in Poughkeepsie, New York allowed Jim many opportunities to bug his family about the snow. Now, living in North Carolina allows him to bug them about hurricanes as well!\n\nJim’s road to Eastern Carolina went from a childhood in upstate New York to his adolescence in South Florida. Looking out the airplane window his first time flying into West Palm Beach, Jim turned to his mom and said “look, there’s snow on the ground!” Jim says she gave him a funny smile. The smile turned into a frown when they stepped off the plane and Jim realized that the “snow” was sand, and the air felt like a furnace! This is just one of many experiences that fueled Jim’s desire to learn more about the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nJim’s passion for weather took him to Florida State University, where he received a Bachelor’s degree in Meteorology. Within a week, he secured his first job, as the morning meteorologist for a Panama City, Florida television station. Although he was very excited about his first job, he quickly discovered one big problem. He would have to readjust his alarm clock from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. Strong coffee and cold showers became a regular part of his morning!\n\nJim says he was a fully transformed “morning person” when offered the opportunity to work as the meteorologist on WITN-7 News at Sunrise in 2001. With family in both New York and Florida, Eastern Carolina has proved to be the perfect location for Jim. He says being a part of WITN-7 News at Sunrise has been rewarding beyond his expectations. The people of Eastern Carolina are as kind and generous as any he’s ever met, and the variety of weather keeps him on his toes! From snow and hurricanes to severe thunderstorms and flooding threats, Jim says there’s one thing that can be definitely said about our climate:\n\n“There’s gonna be weather, whether or not!”","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"expertise":"Weather analysis, forecasting and

Before moving to North Carolina Eric was the Sports Director at WABI TV5 in Bangor, Maine, for the last two years. He worked for WABI for 5-1/2 years before that as Sports Anchor/Reporter. In that time he, and former Sports Director Tim Throckmorton, won multiple awards together from the Maine Association of Broadcasters for top sportscast. Eric also earned best play-by-play for the station's state football broadcasts. Before moving to Maine he lived and worked in his home state of Minnesota. First at KEYC in North Mankato and then at KQDS Fox 21 in Duluth. He started his career in Bangor, Maine, at ABC 7/Fox 22 as a production assistant before being promoted to photojournalist there. \n\nIn his spare time, Eric loves to be outdoors. From hiking mountains or kayaking to hunting and fishing. He also can be found working on his golf game and still plays hockey in the local adult league.
